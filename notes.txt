Further Detailed  in the README.

Tl;Dr for Setup, Usage and Specs:

1. install docker desktop and docker-compose cli if not already installed
2. `docker-compose run backend bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed db:test:prepare dev:cache` to setup backend
3. `docker-compose run frontend yarn install` to setup frontend
4. `docker-compose up` to run the application
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the application
6. `docker-compose run backend rake test` to run backend specs
7. `docker-compose run frontend yarn test` to run frontend specs
8. `docker exec -it -e REQUESTS=10 backend bin/rails performance:redirect` to run redirect performance benchmark
9. `docker exec -it -e REQUESTS=10 backend bin/rails performance:create` to run create performance benchmark


Basic Assumptions and Trade Offs:
1) There were no restrictions on the short url length. My decision was to keep this simple with a consistent 11
character identifier that would reduce the possibility of collisions to practically zero. Other solutions were considered
that could reduce the character count if required. Some more information on this in the readme.
2) This will be run in a desktop browser with a mouse and keyboard. Minimal considerations made for mobile first design,
screen readers or keyboard navigation as a matter of time constraint.
3) Peformance considerations will be made with the docker system limitations in mind. There are many ways to scale performance
horizontally but which are impractical for a local/development proof of concept.

Looking forward to discussing any of this further.
